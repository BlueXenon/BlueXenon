Chapter One Exercises
Exercise Set 1:
1. Complete (yes/no)?  Yes

2. The behavior is not the same both times.

Analysis Question Set 1:
1. The program models a body of water by making the background blue like water.  The grid lines represent locations that the fish can exist in.

2. The fish can occupy any one of the boxes in the grid.  Two fish cannot occupy the same box at the same time.

3. The fish face different directions.  The fish's direction is determined by which direction they last moved/turned in.

4. The fish moves in every step.  It moves one space.  It moves in different directions.  It can move in any direction except directly behind itself.
	It does not seem more likely to move in one direction over another.

Exercise Set 2:
1.	Timestep	Fish's location		Fish's Direction	Did it move?	In what direction?	New location	New direction
	1				(2,2)					North			Yes					North			Yes			No
	2				(1,2)					North			Yes					North			Yes			No
	3				(1,1)					West			Yes					West			Yes			Yes
	4				(2,1)					South			Yes					South			Yes			Yes
	5				(2,0)					West			Yes					West			Yes			Yes


2. Our results were very different in terms of directions and locations.  However, in both of our results, the fish moved in every timestep
	and always moved to an adjacent location.  I can conclude that the fish always move to an adjacent cell, they face the direction they moved
	in, and they don't move backwards.  I am not confident that I have enough data; despite this test, we have still been debating whether the fish 
	are more likely to turn in a certain direction and things like that.

	19				(0,2)				East				Yes					East			Yes				Yes
	20				(0,3)				East				Yes					East			Yes				No

Analysis Question Set 3:
1. The locations in an environment are numbered based on row number and column number, with 0 being the first location for each.

Exercise Set 3:
1. When running fish.dat, the environment size and the starting location/direction of each fish match the information defined
   in fish.dat.
2. The configuration of the environment matched the locations and directions that I defined.
	(created file is called fourfish.dat)
